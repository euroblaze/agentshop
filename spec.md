This document outlines the design and functionality for the initial version of a simple online shop dedicated to selling AI agent software. The aim is to provide a clear, user-friendly experience for customers.

#### Shop Structure and Navigation
The shop will feature a straightforward layout. The front page will serve as the primary entry point, clearly stating the shop's purpose and showcasing a few promotional product blocks. A header will contain a simple navigation menu, while a footer will provide links to essential resources and static content pages.

#### Search Functionality
A search field will be prominently placed at the top of the shop's interface. Users will be able to enter a search phrase into this field. Upon submission, the system will process the query and display a product hit list, presenting relevant products that match the search criteria.

#### Product Presentation
Each AI agent software product will have its own dedicated product page. These pages will be rich with information, including screenshots illustrating the software's interface and functionality. A detailed technical description will accompany these visuals, often supplemented by descriptive process diagrams to explain complex features.

#### Product Offering and Pricing
The shop will offer two distinct purchasing models. Some products will be listed with a clear price and can be purchased directly via a "Buy" button. For other, potentially more specialized, products, customers will need to inquire about the price, which will then be sent to them via email as a personalized quotation.

#### Customer Feedback: Thumbs Up Reviews
To gather customer feedback, a simple "thumbs up" review system will be implemented. Customers can provide a "thumbs up" for a product by answering a human validation question in a pop-up window. No user login will be required for this feature. All "thumbs up" counts will be stored in a database, linked to the respective product information.

#### Product Information and Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
Product descriptions will be stored as HTML pages. These pages will incorporate specific e-commerce related tags for elements such as the product title, short description, full description, and price. This tagging is crucial for search engine optimization (SEO), allowing web crawlers and product catalogs to automatically index and categorize your products, improving visibility in search results. The visual design of these pages will prioritize readability, featuring a top-to-bottom structure that mixes images and text blocks effectively, along with a simple, easy-on-the-eyes color scheme.

#### The Purchase Process
When a customer decides to purchase a product, a pop-up window will appear. The first screen of this pop-up will prompt the user to provide their name, address, email address, and telephone number. The second screen will then redirect to a credit card payment page, which will be processed securely by either Stripe or PayPal, giving the customer a choice of payment gateway.

Upon successful payment, a third screen will display a "Thank You" message. On this success screen, the user will also be asked if they wish to receive a quotation for an installation service. If the user opts in, a new section will appear, prompting them to provide the following details:

- Odoo Version: A selection of Odoo versions via radio buttons.
- Installation Period: A date picker to specify the desired timeframe for the installation.
- Comments: A text field for any additional notes or requirements.
- Responsible Technical Contact Name: A field for the name of the technical contact person.
- Responsible Technical Contact Email: A field for the email address of the technical contact.

This installation service inquiry, if completed, will also trigger an email to the shop operator, containing all the provided details for quotation generation. If the payment is unsuccessful, a specific problem or error message will be reported to the user.

#### Order Fulfillment and Communication
Following a successful order, an email will be automatically sent to the customer. This email will confirm that their order has been successfully processed and payment received. Crucially, it will also include a link to download the purchased software. These download links will be securely stored in a simple backend database. Additionally, an email containing the customer's data, the product number, payment confirmation transaction number, and payment processor information will be sent to the seller's designated email address, which will be stored in a configuration file.

#### Customer Data Persistence and Personalization
For enhanced user experience, if a user provides their name, address, and phone number during a purchase, this information will be stored in their browser session. Upon their return to the website, the system will use this stored data to greet them personally in the header's top-right corner, for example, "Hello [First Name] [Last Name]". While this version does not include a login feature, dedicated whitespace will be reserved in the design for the future integration of customer accounts.

#### Product Resources and Static Content
Each product description page will include a link to its corresponding README file, with these links also stored in the database for easy management. Beyond product pages, the shop will host various static content pages in a separate directory. These will include essential information such as operator details, terms and conditions, disclaimers, privacy policy, and a support page. All static content pages will also be structured with clean, simple HTML for optimal readability.

#### Customer Inquiry Feature
At the bottom of each product description page, there will be a simple "Ask a question about the product" section. This feature will also incorporate human validation. Once a question is submitted, an email will be sent to the shop operator, including the sender's email address, enabling the operator to reply directly.

#### Database and Technical Considerations
For data storage, a small and simple database solution like SQLite will be utilized. During the order process, it is mandatory for the customer to agree to the terms and conditions. All required fields in the purchase pop-up will be validated; any missing or invalid fields will be immediately highlighted in red with a short message prompting the user to correct them.

#### Language and Future Scalability
For its initial release, the shop will be available in a single language: English. However, the architecture will be designed to allow for future expansion to support multiple languages. This first version aims to establish a solid foundation, keeping possibilities open for subsequent versions with additional functionalities.
