This document outlines the design and functionality for the initial version of a simple online shop dedicated to selling AI agent software. The aim is to provide a clear, user-friendly experience for customers.

#### Shop Structure and Navigation
The shop will feature a straightforward layout. The front page will serve as the primary entry point, clearly stating the shop's purpose and showcasing a few promotional product blocks. A header will contain a simple navigation menu, while a footer will provide links to essential resources and static content pages.

#### Search Functionality
A search field will be prominently placed at the top of the shop's interface. Users will be able to enter a search phrase into this field. Upon submission, the system will process the query and display a product hit list, presenting relevant products that match the search criteria.

#### Product Presentation
Each AI agent software product will have its own dedicated product page. These pages will be rich with information, including screenshots illustrating the software's interface and functionality. A detailed technical description will accompany these visuals, often supplemented by descriptive process diagrams to explain complex features.

#### Product Offering and Pricing
The shop will offer two distinct purchasing models. Some products will be listed with a clear price and can be purchased directly via a "Buy" button. For other, potentially more specialized, products, customers will need to inquire about the price, which will then be sent to them via email as a personalized quotation.

#### Customer Feedback: Thumbs Up Reviews
To gather customer feedback, a simple "thumbs up" review system will be implemented. Customers can provide a "thumbs up" for a product by answering a human validation question in a pop-up window. No user login will be required for this feature. All "thumbs up" counts will be stored in a database, linked to the respective product information.

#### Product Information and Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
Product descriptions will be stored as HTML pages. These pages will incorporate specific e-commerce related tags for elements such as the product title, short description, full description, and price. This tagging is crucial for search engine optimization (SEO), allowing web crawlers and product catalogs to automatically index and categorize your products, improving visibility in search results. The visual design of these pages will prioritize readability, featuring a top-to-bottom structure that mixes images and text blocks effectively, along with a simple, easy-on-the-eyes color scheme.

#### The Purchase Process
When a customer decides to purchase a product, a pop-up window will appear. The first screen of this pop-up will prompt the user to provide their name, address, email address, and telephone number. The second screen will then redirect to a credit card payment page, which will be processed securely by either Stripe or PayPal, giving the customer a choice of payment gateway.

Upon successful payment, a third screen will display a "Thank You" message. On this success screen, the user will also be asked if they wish to receive a quotation for an installation service. If the user opts in, a new section will appear, prompting them to provide the following details:

- Odoo Version: A selection of Odoo versions via radio buttons.
- Installation Period: A date picker to specify the desired timeframe for the installation.
- Comments: A text field for any additional notes or requirements.
- Responsible Technical Contact Name: A field for the name of the technical contact person.
- Responsible Technical Contact Email: A field for the email address of the technical contact.

This installation service inquiry, if completed, will also trigger an email to the shop operator, containing all the provided details for quotation generation. If the payment is unsuccessful, a specific problem or error message will be reported to the user.

#### Order Fulfillment and Communication
Following a successful order, an email will be automatically sent to the customer. This email will confirm that their order has been successfully processed and payment received. Crucially, it will also include a link to download the purchased software. These download links will be securely stored in a simple backend database. Additionally, an email containing the customer's data, the product number, payment confirmation transaction number, and payment processor information will be sent to the seller's designated email address, which will be stored in a configuration file.

#### Customer Account System
The shop will feature a comprehensive customer account system. Customers can create accounts, log in, and access a personalized dashboard. In their account area, customers can:
- View their order history and order details
- Re-order previously purchased products
- File returns or customer support requests
- Reset their password via email
- Update their profile information
- Log in and log out securely

Customer account information will be stored in the SQLite database, with secure password hashing and session management.

#### Product Resources and Static Content
Each product description page will include a link to its corresponding README file, with these links also stored in the database for easy management. Beyond product pages, the shop will host various static content pages in a separate directory. These will include essential information such as operator details, terms and conditions, disclaimers, privacy policy, and a support page. All static content pages will also be structured with clean, simple HTML for optimal readability.

#### Customer Inquiry Feature
At the bottom of each product description page, there will be a simple "Ask a question about the product" section. This feature will also incorporate human validation. Once a question is submitted, an email will be sent to the shop operator, including the sender's email address, enabling the operator to reply directly.

#### Admin Backend System
The shop will include a comprehensive admin backend accessible only to the shop owner. After logging in with secure admin credentials, the owner can:
- View and manage all customers and their details
- View and manage all orders with full order information
- Browse a complete list of products with the ability to click and view detailed product descriptions
- Access content management pages with a simple HDMI editor supporting minimal formatting
- Manage configuration settings through a web interface
- View sales analytics and customer support requests
- Manage returns and customer inquiries

The admin area will be protected by secure authentication and provide a clean, intuitive interface for shop management.

#### Database and Technical Considerations
For data storage, a small and simple database solution like SQLite will be utilized. All configuration variables, previously stored in configuration files, are now centralized in the SQLite database and manageable through the admin backend. During the order process, it is mandatory for the customer to agree to the terms and conditions. All required fields in the purchase pop-up will be validated; any missing or invalid fields will be immediately highlighted in red with a short message prompting the user to correct them.

#### Language and Future Scalability
For its initial release, the shop will be available in a single language: English. However, the architecture will be designed to allow for future expansion to support multiple languages. This first version aims to establish a solid foundation, keeping possibilities open for subsequent versions with additional functionalities.

#### ORM Layer Architecture
The shop will implement a comprehensive Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer to facilitate seamless communication between the TypeScript frontend and the Python backend. This ORM layer will be implemented in Python and will serve as the primary interface for all database operations and business logic.

##### ORM Structure and Components
The ORM layer will be built using Python's SQLAlchemy framework, providing a robust and scalable foundation for data management. The ORM will consist of several key components:

- **Model Definitions**: Python classes that represent database tables including Products, Customers, Orders, Reviews, Inquiries, and Configuration settings
- **Data Access Layer**: Repository pattern implementation for each model providing CRUD operations, complex queries, and business logic
- **API Serializers**: JSON serialization and deserialization for communication with the TypeScript frontend
- **Validation Layer**: Data validation and business rule enforcement before database operations
- **Migration System**: Database schema versioning and migration management

##### Database Connection and Session Management
The ORM will handle database connections through SQLAlchemy's session management system. Connection pooling will be implemented to ensure optimal performance under concurrent user loads. All database operations will be wrapped in appropriate transaction boundaries to maintain data integrity.

##### Frontend-Backend Communication
The TypeScript frontend will communicate with the Python backend through RESTful API endpoints. The ORM layer will expose these endpoints using a Python web framework (Flask or FastAPI), with each endpoint corresponding to specific business operations:

- **Product Operations**: Retrieve product listings, search products, get product details
- **Customer Operations**: User registration, authentication, profile management, order history
- **Order Operations**: Create orders, process payments, track order status
- **Review Operations**: Submit reviews, retrieve review counts
- **Admin Operations**: Manage products, customers, orders, and configuration settings

##### Data Models and Relationships
The ORM will define clear relationships between entities:
- One-to-many relationships between Customers and Orders
- Many-to-many relationships between Products and Orders
- One-to-many relationships between Products and Reviews
- Foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity

##### Security and Performance Considerations
The ORM layer will implement several security measures:
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Input sanitization and validation
- Secure session management with token-based authentication
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Encrypted storage of sensitive data

Performance optimizations will include:
- Lazy loading for related objects
- Query optimization and indexing
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Database connection pooling

##### API Response Format
All API responses will follow a consistent JSON format:
```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "data": object|array,
  "message": string,
  "errors": array
}
```

This standardized format ensures predictable communication between the frontend and backend, simplifying error handling and data processing on the TypeScript side.
